# Rhyme Know Reason Programming Training Week 1 Homework Demo

## Hello World
#### For this challenge, you need to make the HelloWorld file print "Hello World!" to the terminal.
We've already gone over how to do this, so it should be super easy. 
The point of this part is just to give you some practice with the answer checking system.

Before you do the challenge, use the "Run Tests" configuration to see the test fail. 
Once you complete this challenge, you should see that the test is passing. 
If that's not what you see, you can look at why the test failed and fix it.

Note that if there are any syntax errors anywhere in the project (including in other challenges) the tests will not be able to run, and you will not be able to run this program.

You can run this program by selecting "HelloWorld" from the Run Configurations dropdown and pressing the run button next to it (once all syntax errors are dealt with).
